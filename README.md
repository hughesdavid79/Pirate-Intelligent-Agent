# Pirate-Intelligent-Agent

Brief Explanation of the Work

For this project, I was provided with starter code that included the basic structure for training a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning. The given code laid out a high-level approach to training the agent, including pseudocode for the main training loop and utility functions.

The changes I made were focused on implementing the Q-training function, where I introduced several critical adjustments to enhance the agent's learning process:

    Learning Rate Decay: I implemented a slightly slower decay rate for the learning rate (decayRate = 0.05), which helps the model to continue learning effectively over more epochs.
    
    Epsilon Decay: I adjusted the epsilon decay to be slower (epsilon_decay = 0.995), which allows for more exploration in the early stages of training, ensuring the agent doesn't converge too quickly on a potentially suboptimal strategy.
    
    Minimum Epsilon: I set a minimum epsilon value (min_epsilon = 0.1) to prevent the exploration rate from decreasing too much, maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation throughout the training process.
    
    Game State Handling: The updated code more explicitly handles the game states, including the selection of valid actions, tracking the win history, and logging the progress after each epoch.
    
    Performance Logging: I enhanced the logging functionality to provide more detailed feedback during the training process, including information on the loss, number of episodes, win count, and win rate at each epoch.

These changes were necessary to improve the performance of the agent, ultimately leading to achieving a 100% win rate during training.
Connecting Learning to the Larger Field of Computer Science

In this project, I applied key concepts from reinforcement learning and neural networks to a practical problem, which mirrors the kind of work computer scientists often engage in. Computer scientists work to solve complex problems by developing algorithms that can learn and adapt to new data, which is crucial for advancements in AI and machine learning. This work matters because it drives innovation across various fields, from healthcare to finance, where adaptive systems can improve efficiency and outcomes.

Approach to Problem-Solving as a Computer Scientist

As a computer scientist, I approach problems systematically by breaking them down into manageable components. In this project, for instance, I started by understanding the requirements of the intelligent agent, followed by implementing and fine-tuning the Q-learning algorithm. This approach ensures that I can tackle even the most complex challenges effectively.

Ethical Responsibilities

My ethical responsibilities as a computer scientist extend to both the end user and the organization. It is essential to ensure that the systems I develop are fair, transparent, and secure. This includes being mindful of biases that might be present in the data or algorithms and ensuring that the software operates as intended without causing harm. Additionally, protecting the privacy and security of users' data is a paramount concern.
